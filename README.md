# Static-and-non-static-units

There are two major types of CSS units, we have the dynamic and static units. There is a feature of each unit that enables it to be classified under either dynamic or static units.

Dynamic units are the units which are set relative to some other value. A typical example of a dyu=namic unit is the percent. When an item's width or size is set to percent, the item always changes in size upon reduction of the screen width or viewport. This is usually used for websites that will have a mobile view, a desktop and a tablet view as well.

Static units are units that do not change automatically, they are fixed as the sized of their items. Examples of these units are px, em and rem. Icons are typical examples of items which have their width units to be static, more preferably px. Fonts also use rem. This implies that, as the viewports changes the static units remain the same and do not change according to their parent.
